                It all started in London in 2017 when we both took the Conflict and Peacebuilding course during our Master's degree. 
                Back then, we had different friend groups and barely knew each other. This all quickly changed in 2019 when I visited Brussels, 
                where Migue was living and working, to visit one of my friends (I was living in Vienna at that time). 
                We caught up over dinner and drinks in Brussels and quickly started talking every day from a distance, becoming close friends. A few months later, I was looking 
                for a new job and Migue convinced me that Brussels was the best place. Eventually, I got a job and moved to the city in early 2020, 
                Covid hit, and we took many Covid walks together. 
                From there things developed more and more and moving together was just one of many exciting steps in our adventure (this message was approved by Migue).
                <br><br>
                “Migue doesn't like cheesy cringe things (like this section) but he is a sweet, cheesy guy deep down. He is an excellent home chef (one of the best I know), he has a peculiar, fun humor but sometimes he is a bit clumsy (although the number of plates he has smashed by accident has reduced over time). He is very reliable and values his friends deeply.”
                <br><br>          
                “Yasemin is a pretty good home chef too (and a better baker). She is a curious person who likes to pick up new hobbies and maintain a few of them. She enjoys all types of music and likes going to concerts. She´s very sweet (in a figurative way, unrelated to her diabetes :P) and she has shown me how strong and persistent she can be.”
